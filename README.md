Trying to make color scales with accessible text collors using the LCH color space. I'm currently remaking this using Recoil to improve performance. That repo is called `theme-generator`.

This app is live on GitHub Pages at https://danielpickett.github.io/lch-palette-generator/

This is bootstrapped with Create React App. To get it running, just run `yarn`, then start the app with `yarn start`.
